For new users(like for graders), you can simply input your desired new username and click : new user join
if your preferred new username is unfortunately the same as an existing user, the site will show existing username, and then redirect you back to the main page for a new username.
After you create a new username, the next time you come back to this site, you can log as an exisiting user.

The website is graphically  designed using bootstrap, the login page also shows different welcome languages everytime you view it.

After you log in the website,  you can see three columns, the leftmost is where you upload files to your personal directory,
in the middle is your personal directory files,

rightmost is the shared files from other users.



users are also able to share files with all other users, and other users will be able to download shared files.

there is also a tweet button implemented to send quick tweets and tweet about this website after clicking it.
